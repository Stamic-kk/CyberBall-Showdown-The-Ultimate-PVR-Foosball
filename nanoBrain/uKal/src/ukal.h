/*
 * uKal is a discrete time implementation of the Kalman Filter.
 *
 * The definitions and declarations of the filter can be used with both linear 
 * and non-linear systems via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), or nth-Order 
 * Filter (nOF), like a second order Kalman filter (SOF).
 *
 * In the non-linear cases, the user must define their Jacobian (or higher order 
 * derivative) matrices, propagation function, and observation function in a
 * separate unit, and call the set f(x) and h(x) functions on their own.

/**
 * @name ukal_filter_create
 * Create a Kalman filter object with all of the necessary state space system 
 * terms, initial state vector, and initial state covariance/variance matrix.
 *
 * @note The state space form of the system will abide by the following dynamics
 *       equations:
 *       The state vector, x, at filter iteration {k+1}, x_{k+1}, is equal to:
 *       Linear:
 *       x_{k+1} = \Phi_{k}*x_{k} + \gamma_{k}*w_{k}, or
 *       Nonlinear:
 *       x_{k+1} = f_{k}(x_{x}, w_{k}), where,
 *       w_{k} is a zero mean, stochastic, Wiener (Brownian motion) 
 *             process for the k^th iteration of the discrete filter.
 *             Note: Q_{k} = E[w_{k}*w_{k}^T];
 *
 *       \gamma_{k} is the k^th state equation process noise vector;
 *
 *       \Phi_{k} is the state propagation matrix. For linear systems, this
 *                matrix will likely stay constant, for non-linear systems, the 
 *                value can be modified via the set function.
 *
 *       The observation dynamics of the system will follow the following 
 *       equation:
 *       Linear:
 *       y_{k} = H_{k}x_{k} + v_{k}, or,
 *       Nonlinear:
 *       y_{k} = h_{k}(x_{k}) + v_{k}, where,
 *       y_{k} is the observation vector which will contain the kth sensor 
 *             observations;
 *
 *       H_{k} is the observation matrix which maps the state vector to the
 *             measurement states. For non-linear systems, the derivative of
 *             h_{k} can be set via its set function;
 *
 *       v_{k} is the zero mean sensor noise vector.
 *             Note: R_{k} = E[v_{k}*v_{k}^T].
 *
 * @note For N states in the state vector, and M observations in the measurement 
 *       vector:
 *       size(x) = N x 1
 *       size(y) = M x 1
 *
 *       size(\Phi) = N x N
 *       size(\gamma) = N x J
 *       size(Q) = J x J
 *
 *       size(H) = M x N
 *       size(R) = M x M
 * @note For non-linear systems where:
 *                     x_{k+1} = f_{k}(x_{k}, w_{k}), and
 *                     y_{k} = h_{k}(x_{k}) + v_{k}
 *       The filter dynamics will propagate identically to the linear case, but
 *       and the observation matrix function, h, and the state propagation
 *       function, f, will not be updated accordingly. It is the responsibility
 *       of the user of this filter to handle the derivative matrices
 *       accordingly, but their values can be set via the set functions in this
 *       library.
 *
 * @note n_states must be less than or equal to UKAL_MAX_STATE_VECTOR_SIZE.
 * @note n_measurements must be less than or equal to 
 *       UKAL_MAX_MEASUREMENT_VECTOR_SIZE.
 *
 * @param[out] filter The filter to initialize, and set up.
 * @param type The filter type: linear or ekf.
 * @param n_state The number of states in the state vector, x.
 * @param n_measurements The number of observation states in the observation
 *        vector, y.
 * @param[in] Phi The state propagation matrix.
 * @param[in] gamma The state process noise matrix.
 * @param[in] x0 The initial state vector for the state space system.
 * @param[in] Q The process noise covariance matrix.
 * @param[in] P0 The initial state covariance/variance matrix.
 * @param[in] H The observation matrix.
 * @param[in] R The sensor noise covariance matrix.
 *
 * @return A FilterError status code indicating success, or failure.
 *         An invalid argument error can be returned if the dimensions
 *         of the given matrix and vector terms do not match the expected
 *         dimensions. An uninitialized object error can be returned if one
 *         or more matrix objects are not initialized, or the passed in filter
 *         object is not a valid pointer.
